## Description

Heart failure is a pathophysiological state in which the heart fails to supply the required amount of blood
and oxygen to the body. It is a common, costly, chronic and potentially fatal condition widespread all over
the world.
The main aim of this study is to provide statistically relevant methods for identifying the potentially **high-risk patients** in advance and understanding which are the main patient-level features that have an impact
on the re-hospitalization. Moreover, another goal of the project is to find out if there are differences
among patients due to a **possible hospital effect**. Finally, another purpose is to evaluate the impact of
adherence to the **drugs in (re)-hospitalizations**. The study is based on the recordings of the hospitalizations
and the medical prescriptions of 187493 patients from the Lombardy region but in this project, the main
focus is centred on the people from Milano.
